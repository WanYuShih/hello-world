# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.

Hi! I'm Wan-Yu, a musical lover.
I need to constrain myself from describing how much I love Hamilton so I can concentrate on learning GitHub.

Test:
If I make changes in a feature branch while the master branch have been changed, what will happen when I open a Pull Request?

results:
GitHub told me there is one conflicting file to be resolved.
(The massage was showed on the Pull requests page.)
